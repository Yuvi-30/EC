With nearly 70 million deaf-mutes, and an 
additional 360 million being deaf, with 32 million of them being children, one of 
the biggest problems the deaf and the mute community faces is the lack of 
Accessibility and Inclusivity. Currently, there are limited to no options for 
individuals who are deaf or mute to fully participate and engage, especially in a 
conference setting. Traditional methods of communication, such as spoken 
language and auditory cues, are often inaccessible to this community, leading 
to feelings of Isolation and Exclusion, thus making it all the more difficult for 
them to feel “accepted”.
